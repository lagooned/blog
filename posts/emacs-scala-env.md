**emacs** is probably my number one favorite thing in life. so much so, that it is typically the first thing i install on any machine that i'm going to use with any frequency. i will most likely produce many posts about emacs over the course of this blog, and i will love every one of them. this love stems from the extensibility of its human interface; within reason, there is nothing emacs cannot do. it integrates well with gnu file descriptors and streams; has an expressively-unmatched extension language, dubbed **elisp**; and has a community of visionaries that craft astounding software for this... text editor.

while others may use microsoft's rounded-edged **vscode**, a proprietary attempt to capture the extensible editor market; or **vim**, a good editor with a bad extension language; emacs' unparalled database of code, idoms, and community will shine on as part of the computing universe forever.

my emacs config is... [huge](https://github.com/lagooned/emacs)<sup>tm</sup>. i've been using emacs for so long that i've finally gained the confidence to point other emacs users in the right direction. so listen up and copy this down; you'll have a fully functional, free and open source, scala ide in no time.
