{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"emacs-haskell-lsp-environment","contentHtml":"<p>as i said before, there would be many posts about emacs and this is no exception. in this iteration, we are looking at haskell language server protocol integration. as i am currently, and always will be, learning haskell extremely slowly, i figured it necessary to leverage my experience with emacs, lsp, and gnu/linux to reap the benefits of the haskell community's ide integration efforts.</p>\n<h1>terms</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol\">lsp</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>short for <em>language server protocol</em>. this is a standard for implementing a language server for a given language. it defines how to create a REST server which understands its implementing language (whether it be haskell, java, c++, scala, or what have you) and accepts queries which return information which can aid in the development process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.haskell.org\">haskell</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>named after logicial Haskell Curry, Haskell is a general-purpose, statically-typed, &#x26; purely-functional programming language which touts most of the recent innovations in programming and is a consistent source of good ideas for other languages to copy from.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Modes.html\">mode</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>an operating mode for emacs which is enabled upon opening a buffer. a mode usually offers a set of functionality that is useful for the type of buffer that was opened. for example, when opening a <em>*.hs</em> file, <strong>haskell-mode</strong> is started.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Setting-Hooks.html\">hook</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>an unordered list of elisp functions which run when a particular <em>mode</em> is enabled. for example, when <em>haskell-mode</em>, <strong>haskell-mode-hook</strong> is executed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode\">lsp-mode</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a client library for emacs which interacts with servers which implement the language server protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package\">use-package</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a set of elisp functions and macros which makes it easy to lazy-load elisp packages with particular configurations. while it is completely optional, loading elisp packages all at once can be quite time complex and cause very slow start-up time. use of this is very much advised as it will future proof your configurations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>scope</h1>\n<p>as was said in my previous <a href=\"/blog/posts/emacs-scala-env\">scala-lsp post</a>, in order to keep this short, i will only be going over the setup of <em>use-package</em>, <em>lsp-mode</em>, and the operating system configurations required to make a elegant development environment. if you would like to know more about emacs, please check out the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://github.com/lagooned/emacs\">je/emacs</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the configuration that i currently use. it is heavily inspired by <em><a href=\"https://www.spacemacs.org\">spacemacs</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs\">doom-emacs</a></em>. please feel free to copy stuff out of my config or raise a pr, id be happy to have a look at it.</li>\n<li>here you can find the configuration as i implemented it, in terms of my own configuration setup, please feel free to use this as a reference</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://sanemacs.com\">sanemacs</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>provides a good set of sane defaults</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs\">awesome emacs</a></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>a great, frequently updated place to look for and learn about more packages to add to your emacs configuration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>install binaries</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#the-haskell-tool-stack\">stack</a>\n<ul>\n<li>follow the guide for this and make sure stack is in your <strong>user-wide ~/.profile $PATH</strong> (see the guide <a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/how-to-permanently-set-path-in-linux/#usingaprofilefiletosetyourpath\">here</a> for help) so that emacs can see it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server\">haskell-language-server</a>\n<ul>\n<li>either build from source or download the pre-compiled binaries; again making sure it is in your <strong>user-wide ~/.profile $PATH</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>use-package: what do?</h1>\n<p>i previously went over the syntax for <strong>use-package</strong> <strong><a href=\"/blog/posts/emacs-scala-env#using-use-package\">here</a></strong>, as well as the initial <strong>package.el</strong> setup <strong><a href=\"/blog/posts/emacs-scala-env#setting-up-package-el\">here</a></strong>. perform both of these on your local machine to continue.</p>\n<h1>setting up lsp</h1>\n<p>with your init.el setup to handle packages, you can now add the following in order to finish the emacs portion of the setup</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-elisp\">(use-package company\n  :ensure t\n  :diminish company-mode\n  :commands company-mode\n  :hook (prog-mode . company-mode))\n\n(use-package lsp-mode\n  :ensure t\n  :commands lsp)\n\n(use-package haskell-mode\n  :ensure t\n  :hook (haskell-mode . haskell-doc-mode)\n  :commands haskell-mode\n  :init\n  (add-hook\n   ;;

configure new stack project</h1>\n<p>to create a new project that is compatible with this setup, we can use stack:</p>\n<p><code>$ stack new hello-hs new-template</code></p>\n<p>this will create a new directory, named <strong>hello-hs</strong>, containing a stack project that you can fill with haskell goodness. next step is to set the stack ghc resolver to the latest version that is compatible with the version of <strong>haskell-language-server</strong> that was previously installed. at the time of writing this, the latest version of the language server i could install was <em>8.10.3</em>, so i specified this in my <strong>./stack.yaml</strong> inside the newly created project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">packages:\n- .\nresolver: ghc-8.10.3\n</code></pre>\n<p>once you've done this, cd to the root of the project and run</p>\n<p><code>$ stack build</code></p>\n<p>to automatically install an isolated ghc of the required version. it may seem like we are completely done, but there is one more step, configuring <strong>./hie.yaml</strong>. due to this being just a basic guide, and also that i don't know that much about it than you do, i will only supply a basic hie.yaml, as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">cradle:\n  stack:\n    - path: \"./app\"\n      component: \"hello-hs\"\n    - path: \"./src\"\n      component: \"hello-hs:lib\"\n    - path: \"./test\"\n      component: \"hello-hs:test:hello-hs-test\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>this file advises the language server of the project structure so that it can provide features like go-to-definition, refactoring, and linting. i believe that this step will be added to the language server itself at some point as well so it might not be worth covering it in much detail. after creating this file, you should be able to load up Main.hs/Lib.hs/Spec.hs and start programming modern haskell.</p>\n<p>i hope this setup starts breaking down the haskell confusion barrier for you so that you can learn what this eye-opening language has to offer, as opposed to just listening about others talk about it.</p>\n<p>-jared</p>\n","title":"make haskell less intimidating with emacs & lsp","date":"2021-02-25"}},"__N_SSG":true}
